This is a tutorial by Dogey#9999, this is a simple tutorial for noobs that can't learn shit at all. 
I'm gonna be teaching the most basic roblox lua logic ever. 
Example: How to use a RS, how to make loops. I have many simple tutorial's, I can make this an auto-updater tutorial. 
For the first log of this simple roblox lua tutorial, I will teach you guys how to use a remotespy for a simulator. 
I will include an auto-sell and auto-farm. 
I hope this tutorial doesn't get skidded. This is the legit worst tutorial but, I hope it helps some noobs. 
I'm going to put my RS down here as local RS. 
Now, on with the tutorial.
]]
local RS = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hillsides/Game-Frickers/master/R2S_V2_V3.lua'))() -- Run this with your exploit. 

-- Now, get a shitty simulator. Do something that fills your inventory, example: blow a bubble in bubble gum simulator. 
-- Doing that will fire a remote event. 
--A remote event should look like this
local event = [[local A_1 = "BlowBubble"
local Event = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").NetworkRemoteEvent
Event:FireServer(A_1)
]]
-- Remove the [[]] obviously. 

-- We now need a loop for auto-farm

_G.AutoFarm = true 
while _G.AutoFarm do 
wait() -- If we don't have a wait, our game will crash. 
local A_1 = "BlowBubble"
local Event = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").NetworkRemoteEvent -- The event
Event:FireServer(A_1)
wait() -- Another wait at the end
end -- we have to add an end to end the script, on certain occasions, you might have to add 2. 

-- Now, we will add an auto sell, this will be a bit different. You should use DEX to find the sell circle. 
-- Find the location of the autosell and boom. Just do what I'm doing in this one here.
-- Some simulator's will have a location for the sell but, in this example, sell is a event. 
-- Bubble Gum Simualtor has a location detect for the sell, therefore I can't fire the remote of the sell and expect a sell of my bubbles. 
_G.AutoSell = true
while _G.AutoSell do 
wait(5)
for i, v in pairs(game:GetService("Workspace").Activations.Sell:GetChildren()) do 
game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = v.CFrame 
wait(1)
end
end

-- There we have it, an auto-farm with auto sell. 
-- We can spice it up with some auto pickup coins. 
-- Sadly, Bubble Gum Sim is so shitty they don't have a folder for coins that is organized. Therefore, I can't make a good coin pickup. 

--With that being said, that's the tutorial on how to use a remote spy. 
-- This will be auto-updated every week or day. 
-- If you want to speak with me, add me on discord, Dogey#9999 or join Kermit's Hub Discord, https://discord.gg/tErTvx2. 
-- Goodbye. 



-- If you read this far, next tutorial will be on how to use variables and other simple things
